For supervised learning, you might want to consider sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier and Regressor which accept missing values encoded as NaNs natively. Alternatively, it is possible to preprocess the data, for instance by using an imputer transformer in a pipeline or drop samples with missing values. See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html You can find a list of all estimators that handle NaN values at the following page: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#estimators-that-handle-nan-values",

Alternatively, it is possible to preprocess the data, for instance by using an imputer transformer in a pipeline or drop samples with missing values.

    "🔧 Random Forest Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 n_estimators=100\n",
    "Number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "More trees = better generalization, but longer training time.\n",
    "Rule of thumb: start with 100–300; increase if your dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 max_depth=None\n",
    "How deep each tree is allowed to grow.\n",
    "None means nodes are expanded until pure or until all leaves contain < min_samples_split.\n",
    "Deeper trees → more complex rules → risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 random_state=42\n",
    "Makes the model reproducible.\n",
    "Fixes the randomness so you get the same result every time you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 class_weight='balanced'\n",
    "Adjusts weights inversely proportional to class frequencies.\n",
    "Useful when classes are imbalanced (e.g. too many graduates vs. few dropouts).\n",
    "Other option: class_weight={0:2, 1:1, 2:1} (manual tuning).\n",

    "📥 X (IInput Features) — Conditions & Types\n",
    "Random Forest can handle mixed data types, but you must still preprocess appropriately:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Type\tExamples\tNotes\n",
    "✅ Numeric\tAge, GPA, Grade average\tOK without encoding\n",
    "✅ Binary\tGender (0/1), Scholarship (Yes/No)\tConvert Yes/No to 0/1\n",
    "⚠️ Categorical\tCourse Name, Nationality, Father’s Job\tMust be encoded\n",
    "❌ Text\tFree-text essay, names\tMust be vectorized or dropped\n",
    "❌ High-cardinality\t100+ unique categories (e.g. 500 job titles)\tRisk of overfitting — avoid or group them\n",
    "### ----------\n",
    "✅ How to Encode Categorical Columns:\n",
    "Use LabelEncoder or pd.get_dummies() for most.\n",
    "Avoid keeping strings directly.\n",
    "### ----------\n",
    "🎯 y (Target Variable) — Conditions\n",
    "Requirement\tExample\n",
    "✅ Must be categorical or discrete\te.g., 0 = dropout, 1 = enrolled, 2 = graduated\n",
    "❌ No continuous/float values\tUse regression instead of classification\n",
    "Can be:\tintegers, strings (if using LabelEncoder)\n",
    "### ----------\n",
    "⚠️ What to Avoid\n",
    "Mistake\tWhy It’s a Problem\n",
    "Keeping raw strings or object dtype\tTrees can't handle text directly\n",
    "Too many missing values\tCauses unreliable splits\n",
    "No feature scaling\tNot needed for trees — unlike SVM/LogReg\n",
    "Unbalanced classes + no class_weight\tModel may ignore minority class\n",
    "Using irrelevant or highly correlated features\tAdds noise; harms performance\n",
    "Data leakage\tDon't include features that leak the target (e.g. final grade when predicting dropout)\n",
    "### ----------\n",
    "🎯 What to Aim for in X (Input)\n",
    "Best Practice\tDescription\n",
    "Cleaned & preprocessed\tNo NaN, strings, or irrelevant cols\n",
    "Compact\t10–100 features is good starting point\n",
    "Encoded properly\tCategorical → OneHot / LabelEncoded\n",
    "Balanced information\tAvoid too many similar/redundant features\n",
    "Derived Features\tFeature engineering like ratios or differences can help (e.g. \"approved/enrolled\")\n",
